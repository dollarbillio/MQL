```Variables``` used in c++
* Computer uses 1 byte as basic memory unit
* ```sizeof(datatype)```: show data type memory
---
```int```: 32 bit-4 byte, store value from -2^31 to 2^31 as 1 bit used to represent (-) or (+)
```unsigned int```: 32 bit-4byte, store value from 0 to 2^32
```char```: 1 byte of data - 8 bit - 2^8, char can be ```number`` assigned but will return character
```short```: 2 byte data - 16 bit - 2^16
```long```: 4 bytes data - 32 bit - 2^32
```float```: 4 bytes ```5.2f```
```double```: 4 bytes
